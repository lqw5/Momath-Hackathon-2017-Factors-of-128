# Momath Hackathon 2017: Factors of 128

Project Category: Dynamic Wall

Team members: Lauren Wong

The Math:

This project utilizes the Dynamic Wall to show the factors of 128. It shows how 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 go into 128 with no remainder.

The Submission:

This project utilizes the Dynamic Wall to show how groups of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 can be used to push all of the slats forward with no remainder. For each factor, the slats are pushed forward in groups of that factor, then they are all pushed back to be reset for the next factor. The slats provide an easy and interesting way to see how these factors go into 128. The target audience is younger visitors (about 3rd to 6th grade). This project provides them an interesting way to learn more about factors and division.
